# Manages weather forecast data with intelligent caching capabilities.
#
# This model stores both current weather conditions and extended 5-day forecast data
# with a 30-minute time-to-live (TTL) caching strategy. It handles automatic cache
# expiration and provides convenient methods for cache status checking.
#
# The extended forecast data is stored as JSON and automatically parsed when accessed.
# This approach optimizes API usage while maintaining data freshness.
#
# @example Creating a new forecast
#   forecast = WeatherForecast.create!(
#     zip_code: "78701",
#     current_temperature: 75.0,
#     high_temperature: 85.0,
#     low_temperature: 65.0,
#     description: "partly cloudy",
#     forecast_data: extended_data.to_json,
#     cached_at: Time.current
#   )
#
# @example Retrieving cached forecast
#   cached = WeatherForecast.cached_forecast_for("78701")
#   cached.from_cache? #=> true (if within 30 minutes)

  # Orders by cached_at timestamp to ensure the most recent forecast is returned.
  #
  # @param zip_code [String] the ZIP code to search for
  # @return [WeatherForecast, nil] the most recent fresh forecast or nil if none found
  #
  # @example
  #   forecast = WeatherForecast.cached_forecast_for("90210")
  #   if forecast
  #     puts "Cached temperature: #{forecast.current_temperature}Â°F"
  #   else
  #     puts "No fresh cache available, need to fetch from API"
